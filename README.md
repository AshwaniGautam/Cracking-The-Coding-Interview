# Cracking-The-Coding-Interview

This Repository, as the name suggest, consists of solutions to the problems/exercise given in the book "Cracking The Coding Interview" 6th Edition.
Again, these are not the ONLY solution.

If you find any bug, Edge case failing, or implementational fault. Feel free to Pull. 
I have, to the best of my knowledge, mentioned any assumption i made in the programs. Would be adding more problems.

Cleanup.sh is a Bash file, It removes ALL the FILES in the current directory except cpp and Bash files.
